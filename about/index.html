    <p class="body-copy-display">Suitless generally works with companies that have at least $500k in revenue or funding and are hiring 5 or more employees within the next year.  Please keep us in mind if you run into any entrepreneurs or small business owners whose businesses fit this profile.  We pay generous referral fees, but more importantly, we're looking to work with great people.</p>
